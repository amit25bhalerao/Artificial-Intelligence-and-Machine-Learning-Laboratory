List of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning Programs included in the repository:

Program 1 • Implement A* Search algorithm.

Program 2 • Implement AO* Search algorithm.

Program 3 • For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the 
set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

Program 4 • Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this 
knowledge to classify a new sample.

Program 5 • Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

Program 6 • Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, 
considering few test data sets.

Program 7 • Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these 
two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program.

Program 8 • Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library 
classes can be used for this problem.

Program 9 • Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regressionalgorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
